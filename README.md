This repository will host fully reproducible input data and scripts of data exploration, prior predictive checks, model fitting, model checking, and posterior predictions and plotting for the forthcoming paper *Fluid hunter motivation in Central Africa: effects on behaviour, bushmeat, and income*. As of 07/09/22 The paper is soon to be submitted for peer review, and content will be posted when it is accepted for publication.

Anonymised full data will further be available under conditions by the end of 2022 in the WILDMEAT database: [https://www.wildmeat.org](https://www.wildmeat.org.). 

Shiny participatory apps in English and French, and forthcoming apps and updates are at: [https://www.nadagabon.org](https://www.nadagabon.org.) 

<!---To run the code, download the entire repository and run scripts within the R project. The 3 scripts are as follows:

* **clean_transects.R**: this runs the diagnostic tool that corrects typos and errors in raw entered paraecologist bushmeat transect data and produces a report of its quality (see section 2.2 of the paper). If you run the script, it creates .csv products in *./outputs/cleaned/*. Similar logic not included in this repository was used cleaning the hunter self-follow data.
* **estimate_offtake.R**: this runs the algorithm used to estimate observed offtake described in section 2.3 of the paper and Appendix S3. If you run the script, it creates a .csv in *./outputs/*. 
* **summarize_offtake.R**: this runs the analyses integrating transect and self-follow data to estimate annual offtake described in section 2.3 of the paper. It further summarizes data and produces examples of figures 4--6 (different than the paper, as using the limited data). Figures 1 & 2 are excluded because their creation requires explicit spatial data; Figure 3 is a photograph. If you run the script, it creates .csv data summaries in *./outputs/* and .pdf graphics in *./outputs/figures/*.

To restore the project library locally onto your machine before running scripts (in case of issues using different package versions), begin by running the following command in the console: `renv::restore()`--->
